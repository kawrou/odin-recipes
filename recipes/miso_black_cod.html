    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle salt over the fish and set it aside for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk the miso, water, mirin, sake and brown sugar together in a small skillet over medium heat until mixture simmers and thickens slightly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the marinade into a flat-bottomed airtight container and let it cool.</li>
            <li>Pour 2 tbsp of sake over the fish to rinse off the salt and gently pat dry with a paper towel to remove the moisture.</li>
            <li>Once the marinade has cooled, place the fish in the marinade and coat the fish on both sides.</li>
            <li>Cover the container and keep it in the refrigerator. You can let it marinade for anywhere between 1 to 3 days depending on how salty you want the dish.</li>
            <li>After letting it marinade, take the fish out of the container and scrape off all the marinade completely.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Place parchment paper on a baking pan and oil it.</li>
            <li>Bake the fish fish until the surface is browned a bit. This takes around 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with rice.</li>
        </ol>
